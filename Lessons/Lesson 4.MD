##Lesson 4

During this lesson we are going to look at loops. When programming, a loop is a piece of code that you can choose to run while a certain condition remains or you can run a loop for as many times as you wish before breaking out and doing something else. Firstly, let's look at a while loop.

A while loop takes the form of **```while boolean do code end```** so an example would be **```while true do turtle.turnRight() end```** If you type this code into the lua environment of the turtle it would run forever as true is always true. To terminate the program, right click the turlte and click ctrl t.

You can also put more than one instruction in the command so as well as turning left you could get the turtle turnig right. **```while true do turtle.turnRight() turtle.turnRight() end```**

When we are using while loops we can use expressions as the boolean condition, let's recap those. If we take the expression **```3 == 3```** the double = is a test for equality, so is the same value on both sides. In this case it is so this would evaluate to true. 

4 < 2 would evaluate to false as 4 is not lower than 2.





In previous lessons you learned how to refuel a turtle and select a slot to use for this as well as placing blocks. During this lesson we will refuel a turtle and use a loop to build a structure. Find a suitable place in your world to make a bridge and place a turtle down.

First, ensure you have some fuel of some kind in slot 1 of your turtle. Then add the maximum amount of cobblestone to slot 2.
