##Lesson 4

In previous lessons you learned how to refuel a turtle and select a slot to use for this as well as placing blocks. During this lesson we will refuel a turtle and use a loop to build a structure. Find a suitable place in your world to make a bridge and place a turtle down.

First, ensure you have some fuel of some kind in slot 1 of your turtle. Then add the maximum amount of cobblestone to slot 2.
