ComputerCraft also comes with a variety of computer components which are all interactive. In this lesson we will look at how to send messages between devices and how to store programs on [floppy disks] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk) (these were used many years ago before the introduction of high capacity USB memory sticks, they had a capacity of 1.44MB, by today's standards you wouldnt even get an mp3 file on a floppy disk.

Set yourself a work area up with (from left to right) a monitor, a computer terminal, and a disk drive like the one below:

Monitors can be joined together to form a larger monitor, this can be useful for displaying larger amounts of text on the screen. Expand your monitor to a 3x3 as below:
