##Lesson 7 - Programming Challenges

[Main Menu] (https://github.com/AllenHeard/ComputerCraft/blob/master/README.md)

In this lesson you will use what you have learned so far to complete some programming challenges. It is wise to write the files onto a disk first and copy them to a turtle when you are ready. If you destroy the turtle by accident you will still have a backup on the disk.

To transfer a program from a disk to a turtle, place a disk drive next to the turtle and twrite the program as you did in lesson 6 then to copy the ifle to the turtle type **```cp disk/program_name turtle_program_name```**

Your task in this lesson is to use what you have learned in the previous 6 lessons to write programs that will create the structures shown below. You will need to look at the [turtle API here](http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle_%28API%29) for commands to make a turtle go up/down
