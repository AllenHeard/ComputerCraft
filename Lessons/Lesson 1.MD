##Lesson 1
In computing, the command line is an important feature. It is an extremely powerful tool and if not used carefully you could do serious damage.

In ComputerCraft we are going to look at some common commands using the command line built in to the mining turtles.
To access the turtles command line, right click on a turtle.

ere the command line understands certain dedicated commands designed for controlling the turtle, we can also access the lua command line by typing lua.

Firstly, type ls or dir to list the files and directories (folders) stored on the turtle.

To make a new directory, type mkdir followed by the name you would like your folder to have, for instance, type mkdir myfiles
